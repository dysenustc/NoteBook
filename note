Hello vonzy,
I am trying testing some VIOs/v-slam on android, my goal is to analyse the result and consumption.
and i have tested ORB_SLAM on android under FangGet's open source, now i want to test VINS，i have implemented
collect camera and IMU data from my android to rosbag dataset, but its not working. i think unsynchronization is 
the main  problem for my data. could you give me some advices and share you no-ros VINS project to me. Very appreciate~
